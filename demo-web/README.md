## Architecture

The demo showcases a complete microservices ecosystem:

- **Ingestor Service**: Polls and normalizes MLS data
- **Enrichment Service**: Adds location scores, taxes, and market data
- **Rent Estimator**: Calculates market rent using comparables
- **Underwriting Service**: Computes investment metrics
- **Alerts Service**: Matches properties to user criteria

All services communicate via Redis event bus with real-time updates.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

### Extending Features

The codebase is structured for easy extension:

- Add new pages in `src/pages/`
- Create reusable components in `src/components/`
- Extend API services in `src/services/`
- Add new data types in `src/types/`

## Integration with Real Services

To connect with actual microservices:

1. Update `src/services/api.ts` to use real endpoints
2. Replace mock data with actual API calls
3. Configure real-time event sources (WebSocket/SSE)
4. Update authentication and authorization

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router 6
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Date Handling**: date-fns

## Browser Support

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
